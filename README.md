# helloWorld
  I'm simply following the "quickstart" github tutorial.

  I'm a first year student at the University of Bucharest,
Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, at the Computers
and Information Technology section.

  Music and coding are my passions. I've been playing guitar
since i was in sixth grade and started playing drums in the
fall of 2021.
